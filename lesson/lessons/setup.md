::: tip
Assuming we are using Windows system...

## Python

There are many ways to install Python.
A straightforward way is to go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and get the latest version (3.9.5).

Then run the executable (.exe file) to install Python on our machine.

Make sure to check the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox.

When installation succeeds, we shall be able to open a command line program (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run a Python shell by typing `python`.

## Git

Git is a very popular version control system that we would use to manage our codes.
To install Git, simply go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and get the latest version (2.31.1).

Then run the executable (.exe file) to install Git on our machine. Accept all the default options.

We will talk about how to use Git in future section, as well as how to [GitHub](https://github.com) to host our codes.

## Visual Studio Code

We would use this popular and powerful editor to write Python codes.
To install Visual Studio Code, simply go to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and get the latest version.

Then run the executable (.exe file) to complete installation.
