# Commenting your Python Codes

<TagLinks />

Comments start with a `#`, and Python will consider rest of the line as a comment.

We can start a new line.

<<< @/lesson/snippets/comment_1.py

Or comment at the end.

<<< @/lesson/snippets/comment_2.py

Comments can be used to explain purpose or logic of the codes, for yourself or your peers who may work on the same piece of codes.
Consider writing comments if the codes are not easy to understand (e.g., algorithm being complicated or logic being complex).

However, writing self-explained codes is also critical in practice.

So instead of

<<< @/lesson/snippets/code_style_1.py

Do this

<<< @/lesson/snippets/code_style_2.py
