## About

Python was created by [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io) and first released on 1991.

Python is a battery-included language that comes with many [builtin functions and standard libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and has a strong ecosystem for numerous [open source libraries](https://pypi.org). It is widely used in many scenarios, such as scientific programming, machine learning, web development, application development, and etc.

## Philosophy

See [PEP-20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than _right_ now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

You can also display them from a Python Shell.
